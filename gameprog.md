## Gameplay video
This video shows off various gameplay sections of the game to give an idea of the general game functionality.

### Use of version control systems, ticket tracking, branching, version control
In our project we have used Git and GitHub for version control and storing of our project code. In our group there was however a large difference between members in knowlegde and experience with using Git, so this is also reflected in our usage of Git. So not everything is optimal in this aspect.

#### Issue tracking
When we started working on the project we made a variety of different issues including what we saw as the main sections neccessary for making the game. These sections could cover a broad aspect of them. For example we had Level Design, HUD, Enemy AI Programming and Gameplay Programming. Because of this there werent that many issues made in general. At that stage we also distributed 4 issues for each group member that we planned to follow, but in the end we had to move members over to different issues to make everything work out. Since that initial creation of issues there were only a couple additional ones created like Main Menu, and an issue opened for a playtesting session. Use of smart commits were hardly uses to refer to specific issues since commits in general were rarely done by majority of members.

#### Branching strategy
For branching strategy there was a difference between each member. Some members did all their work in one single branch that they never moved out of, while others features or sections of their work down into individual branches. In retrospect the branching strategy should likely have been discussed more to settle on one approach at the beginning of the project.

#### Merging branches
Merges were mainly conducted when sections that group members had been working on were finished up. In some situations, group members wanted/required something that was being worked on in another branch. In such cases merges would be done between development branches instead of merging into main, to avoid merging incomplete functionality to the main branch. For the merges themselves, not all members took use of the pull request functionality of GitHub, and just straight up moved their changes directly to main despite using pull requests being the best option. Using pull requests you can more easily track changes being done and potentially easily revert them. Again, in retrospect this should likely have been discussed more clearly in the beginning.
#### Challenges and reflection
Overall our use of version control was not great during the course of the project. We realize that a more clear strategy should have been chosen in the start reflecting group members experience and knowledge. In some cases it would be cleaner if all members used the same strategies even if there existed better alternatives.
